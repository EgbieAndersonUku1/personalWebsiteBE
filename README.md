# Welcome to My Personal Site

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases my projects and skills in software development using various technologies and frameworks. The portfolio website was built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and leverages the Node.js environment, allowing for server-side scripting and enhanced functionalities beyond traditional web browser capabilities.


## Backend Integration for Easier Updates

The site was originally built without a backend. However, as the project grew, updating content became a little tedious because I had to update it manually with text files and then commit the changes again. With the backend, updates will be a lot easier, allowing for more efficient content management.


## Features

- **Project Showcase**: Browse through my featured projects to see what I've been working on.
- **Skill Display**: Learn about the various programming languages, frameworks, and tools I'm proficient in.
- **Contact Information**: You can contact me by clicking [here](mailto:egbieuku@hotmail.com "Contact by email") or through the website.
- **Accessibility**: The website is designed with accessibility in mind and is compatible with screen readers. Semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes are used to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and layout of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for interactivity and dynamic behaviour.
- **Node.js**: Utilised for server-side scripting, handling backend functionalities, and allowing the use of JavaScript outside the browser.
- **Python**: Used for the backend.
- **Django**: For the framework.



## Work in Progress

- **Responsiveness**: The site is not yet optimised for smaller devices, such as tablets and mobile phones. However, improvements in this area are currently underway.
- **Tests**: I will also incorporate tests for the website to ensure robustness and functionality.
